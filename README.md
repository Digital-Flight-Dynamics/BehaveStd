# Behave Standard Library

The standard library for `behave`.

Everything here is documented in the code.

## Using

Add this repository as a submodule, and include `Index.xml` into your project:

```xml
<Include File="Path\\To\\Submodule\\Index.xml">
```

## Help

The `Base/` folder contains documentation of the most basic templates (that everything boils down to) that I could glean from Asobo's templates.
